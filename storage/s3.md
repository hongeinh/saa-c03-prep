# Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
[Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

Overview:
* Object storage
* S3 provides unlimited storage
## Features
* Storage classes: 
    * Frequent access
        * S3 Standard
        * S3 Express One Zone: lowest latency cloud object storage class available today
    * Infrequent access:
        * S3 Standard-IA
        * S3 One Zone-IA
    * Lowest cost archive
        * S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
        * S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
        * S3 Glacier Deep Archive

* Storage management: manage costs, meet regulatory requirements, reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of data for compliance requirements.
    * S3 Lifecycle
    * S3 Object lock
    * S3 Replication
    * S3 Batch operation
* Access management and security
    * By default, S3 buckets and the objects in them are private
    * Use IAM features or configure S3 to allow granular resource permissions based on specific use cases
* Data processing: using S3 Object Lamda or Event notifications
* Storage logging and monitoring tools: use automated or manual monitoring tools
* Analytics and insights: S3 has features to help gain visibility into storage usage
* Storng consistency

## Components
Create bucket (name and region) -> Upload data to bucket as objects
### Buckets
Buckets hold objects.
* Buckets can also have folders
* Up to 100 buckets per account. Can be increased

S3 supports global buckets -> Buckets must be unique across all AWS account in all AWS Regions within a partition.
* A partition is a grouping of Regions.
* Current partitions: aws, aws-cn, aws-us-gov
To create a bucket:
* Enter bucket name -> cannot change after creation
* Choose region -> cannot change after creation
* Default: Block all public access
* Default: Bucket versioning is disabled
* Default: Object lock is disabled
* Storage class is under Bucket's properties

#### Accessing and listing a bucket
### Object
Consist of object data and metadata:
* metadata: set of name-value pairs to describe the object
* Key: name of the object
* Value: data itself (sequence of bytes)
* Version ID: when versioning is enabled on the bucket

Size: 0B to 5TB  
To upload object > 160GB, cannot use drag and drop, must use CLI, SDK or REST API.  
### Key
Unique identifier for an object within a bucket

## Data Consistency model
* Read-after-write consistency (PUT and DELETE)
* Updates to a single key are atomic
