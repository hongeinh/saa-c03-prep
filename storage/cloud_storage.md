# Cloud storage
Cloud storage:
*  enables storing data and files on the internet through a cloud computing provider
* removes the need to buy and manage your own data storage infrastructure
* agility, scalability, and durability, with any time, anywhere data access.

Why is cloud storage important:
* Cost-effective
* Increased agility: staff is largely freed from the tasks of procurement, installation, administration, and maintenance
* Faster deployment
* Efficient data management: perform information management tasks:
    * automated tiering
    * locking down data in support of compliance requirements
* Virtually unlimited scalability
* Business continuity: handle concurrent device failure by quickly detecting and repairing any lost redundancy.

## Types of cloud storage:
* Object storage
    * a data storage architecture that manages data as objects
    * designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data
    * objects are easily accessible from anywhere
    * has scale-out capabilities
    * less costly to store large data volumes
* File storage
* Block storage

## Cloud storage requirements to consider
* Durability and availability
* Security

## Use case
* Analytics and data lakes
* Backup and disaster recovery
* Software test and development
* Cloud data migration
* Compliance
